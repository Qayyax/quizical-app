# Technology I used to build this

I used React js library to build this app. 
Since I had just learnt the basics of React; "components, useStates, useEffects, props". It was only perfect to test my knowledge by building a quiz app which makes use of the concepts I learnt

***

I plan to learn more concepts on React moving forward.
